  overview: {
    about: "This comprehensive layout bootcamp takes you from CSS display basics to advanced grid template areas and responsive fluid cards without needing media query overrides everywhere.",
    whyItMatters: "Layout design is the direct visual handshake between user and software. Modern CSS layouts ensure content looks immaculate on a 4-inch smartphone or a 32-inch 4K monitor.",
    whoShouldLearn: [
      "Developers tired of float hacks and broken margins",
      "Frontend engineers wanting full layout predictability",
      "UI/UX designers implementing their own responsive prototypes",
    ],
    problemsSolved: [
      "Eliminating accidental horizontal scrollbars and overlapping columns",
      "Centering elements vertically and horizontally without fragile position hacks",
      "Building robust, auto-wrapping responsive card grids",
    ],
    prerequisites: ["Basic understanding of HTML and basic CSS selectors"],
  },
  learningOutcomes: [
    "Master the flex container and flex item properties (justify-content, align-items, flex-grow, flex-shrink)",
    "Architect full 2D page templates with CSS Grid using grid-template-columns and grid-template-areas",
    "Know precisely when to deploy Flexbox (1D linear) vs. CSS Grid (2D planar)",

          title: "Flex Container: Main Axis vs. Cross Axis",
          duration: "30 min",
          introduction: "Flexbox operates along two orthogonal axes: the Main Axis (determined by flex-direction) and the Cross Axis.",
          objectives: [
            "Understand how flex-direction dictates main axis orientation",
            "Align items along the main axis with justify-content",
            "Align items along the cross axis with align-items",
          ],
          explanation: "When you set display: flex on a parent container, its direct children transform into flex items. By default, flex-direction is row (left to right). justify-content aligns items horizontally, while align-items aligns them vertically.",
          concepts: ["Main Axis vs. Cross Axis", "justify-content (space-between, center, flex-start)", "align-items (center, stretch)"],

          commonMistakes: ["Trying to use justify-content for vertical centering when flex-direction is row"],
          exercise: "Build a hero call-to-action button group with two buttons aligned with 1rem gap between them.",

            "Apply gap property without dealing with messy margin overrides",
          ],
          explanation: "The magic formula repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)) automatically calculates how many columns can fit in the current screen width. If the screen is small, cards collapse into a single column. As the screen expands, cards automatically form 2, 3, or 4 columns without writing a single media query.",
