  overview: {
    about: "This comprehensive course covers production engineering with Next.js App Router. You will explore Server Components by default, streaming with Suspense, dynamic route segments, metadata SEO APIs, route handlers, and performance optimization.",
    whyItMatters: "The App Router represents modern React architecture. Rendering components on the server reduces bundle sizes, delivers instant initial page loads, and enables optimal search engine indexing.",
    whoShouldLearn: [
      "React developers upgrading to modern Next.js App Router",
      "Full-stack developers building high-performance web applications",
      "Software architects designing scalable modern web systems",
    ],
    problemsSolved: [
      "Drastically reducing client JavaScript bundle sizes using React Server Components",
      "Eliminating waterfall API loading states using parallel fetching and Suspense streaming",
      "Automating SEO metadata, sitemaps, and canonical links natively",
    ],
    prerequisites: ["Strong familiarity with React, modern JavaScript (ES6+), and TypeScript fundamentals"],
  },
  learningOutcomes: [
    "Understand the distinction between React Server Components and Client Components",
    "Architect nested layouts, dynamic routes ([slug]), error boundaries, and not-found pages",
    "Leverage the native Next.js Metadata API for type-safe Open Graph, Twitter, and canonical SEO tags",
    "Build secure backend API Route Handlers (app/api/...) with request validation",

          title: "Server Components by Default & 'use client'",
          duration: "40 min",
          introduction: "In Next.js App Router, every component is a React Server Component (RSC) by default unless explicitly tagged with 'use client'.",
          objectives: [
            "Explain why Server Components do not send JavaScript to the client browser",
            "Identify when to mark a component with 'use client'",
            "Push Client Component boundaries as deep down the component tree as possible",
          ],
          explanation: "Server Components run exclusively on the server during build time or request time. They have direct access to backend resources and databases. Client Components are only needed when using React state (useState), lifecycle hooks (useEffect), or browser event listeners (onClick, onChange).",
          concepts: ["Zero Client-Side JavaScript for Server Components", "Client Boundary ('use client')", "Composition of Server and Client Components"],
