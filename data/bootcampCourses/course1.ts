          duration: "25 min",
          introduction: "Web development is the art and science of engineering applications that live on remote servers and render inside web browsers worldwide.",
          objectives: [
            "Explain the difference between the internet and the World Wide Web",
            "Trace what happens when you type a URL into a browser address bar",
            "Understand IP addresses, DNS lookup, and HTTP/HTTPS client-server handshakes",
          ],
          explanation: "When a user navigates to https://zavera.tech, the browser asks a DNS server to translate that human-readable domain into a machine IP address (e.g. 76.76.21.21). The browser then initiates an HTTP GET request over TCP/IP. The web server processes the request and streams back HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image assets. The browser's layout engine parses the HTML to create the DOM (Document Object Model), attaches styles via the CSSOM, and runs the JavaScript engine.",
