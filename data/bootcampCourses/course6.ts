  overview: {
    about: "This comprehensive course guides you through static typing in modern web engineering. You will learn how TypeScript's compiler checks types at compile time, eliminating null pointer exceptions and type mismatch crashes before code is deployed.",
    whyItMatters: "Large codebases become fragile without static typing. TypeScript provides intelligent IDE autocompletion, self-documenting code, and refactoring confidence.",
