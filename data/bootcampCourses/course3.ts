  overview: {
    about: "This comprehensive course dives into modern ECMAScript specifications, from immutable functional patterns (map, filter, reduce) to concurrency mechanics, asynchronous Promise pipelines, and native ES modules.",
    whyItMatters: "React, Next.js, and Node.js are built entirely upon modern ES6+ paradigms. Mastering these patterns is essential before advancing to component architectures and full-stack web applications.",
    whoShouldLearn: [
      "Developers wanting to transition from legacy jQuery to modern JavaScript",
      "Programmers preparing for React and Next.js frameworks",
      "Backend developers working with asynchronous Node.js servers",
    ],
    problemsSolved: [
      "Eliminating callback hell and unhandled Promise rejections",
      "Avoiding data mutation bugs using spread/rest and immutable array methods",
      "Structuring modular code across multiple files with ES Modules (import/export)",
    ],
    prerequisites: ["Basic understanding of JavaScript variables, functions, and conditionals"],
  },
  learningOutcomes: [
    "Master ES6 syntax: let/const scope, arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring",
    "Manipulate collections immutably using .map(), .filter(), .reduce(), and set operations",
    "Orchestrate asynchronous flows using Promises, async/await, and the Fetch API",
    "Understand the JavaScript Event Loop, Call Stack, Web APIs, and Microtask Queue",
  ],

          id: "js-m1-l1",
          title: "Destructuring, Spread & Rest Operators",
          duration: "30 min",
          introduction: "Destructuring and spread/rest operators allow you to unpack values and compose state objects cleanly with minimal boilerplate.",
          objectives: [
            "Extract object and array values directly into named variables",
            "Clone and merge objects without mutating the original state",
            "Use rest parameters to accept dynamic numbers of function arguments",
          ],
          explanation: "In React and modern JavaScript, mutating data directly causes subtle rendering bugs. The spread operator ({ ...user, active: true }) creates a shallow clone with updated properties, preserving immutability.",
          concepts: ["Object and Array Destructuring", "Spread Operator for Immuntability", "Rest Parameters for Variadic Functions"],
          codeSnippet: `const project = { id: 101, name: "Jobzeta", category: "Web App" };
// Destructuring
const { name, category } = project;

// Immutable update with Spread
const updatedProject = { ...project, status: "Deployed" };
console.log(updatedProject);`,
          codeLanguage: "javascript",
          expectedOutput: "{ id: 101, name: 'Jobzeta', category: 'Web App', status: 'Deployed' }",
          commonMistakes: ["Directly mutating an existing object (project.status = 'Deployed') which violates immutability rules"],
          exercise: "Write a function that accepts an object representing a user, extracts the email, and returns a new object with a verified: true flag without mutating the input.",
          takeaways: ["Immutable updates ensure predictable application state."],

            "Manage loading and error states during data acquisition",
          ],
          explanation: "When you mark a function as async, it returns a Promise. The await keyword pauses function execution until the Promise settles, letting you handle the resolved payload naturally without nesting .then() callbacks.",
          concepts: ["Promises (Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected)", "try / catch / finally blocks", "Response.ok verification in Fetch API"],
