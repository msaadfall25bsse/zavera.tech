      introduction: "Modern web development has evolved from static text documents into sophisticated, interactive software platforms accessible to billions worldwide. In this introductory guide, we outline the foundational principles governing the modern web.",
      sections: [
        {
          heading: "1. The Triad: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript",
          body: "Every web page is fundamentally constructed with three core technologies: HTML provides semantic structure, CSS delivers visual styling and layout, and JavaScript adds reactive behavior. Mastering these three components establishes the strongest foundation for learning any advanced framework.",
        },
        {
          heading: "2. Client vs. Server Architecture",
          body: "The client refers to the user's browser, responsible for rendering UI elements and receiving user interactions. The server runs backend logic, queries databases, authenticates requests, and dispatches data. Modern web architectures often blur this line through Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and edge computations.",
        },
        {
          heading: "3. Tooling and Build Systems",

          heading: "3. When to Combine Both",
          body: "A common industry pattern is using CSS Grid for macro-layout (arranging major sections like sidebars, main feeds, and cards), and Flexbox for micro-layout (arranging icons, titles, and buttons within an individual card).",
